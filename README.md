# TrialByCombat
Hunt the wumpus in cpp
Created by Michael Sheets and Ian Lovell

Created using CLion's CMakeFile in C++11. In order to create the executable use the build command in CLion and the location of the executable will be printed on the console.

For the final design of the game, we decided on going with a father child theme. The Wumpus turned into The Father, gold into Candy, the Hunter into a Child, and the Bats became Air Vents. In order to add new functionality we implemented a Lego Trap that would win the player the game if the Father stepped into it.
